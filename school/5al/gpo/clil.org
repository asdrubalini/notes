#+title: The main aspects of renewable energies

** What is renewable energy?
All energies that gets naturally replenished on a human scale are
considered renewable. For instance, the energy that is produced from
the Sun is considered renewable because, on a human scale, it will
never cease to exist. Popular forms of renewable energy are produced
from wind, sea waves and geothermal heat.
It is important to note that not all renewable energies are also
green energies. Some of them do emit huge amount of greenhouse gases.

** Solar energy
Solar energy is the most popular form of renewable energy. Solar panels nowadays
are cheap, can be installed almost everywhere and don't require much maintenance aside
from dust cleaning. They don't have a great capacity factor (the amount of time energy
is produced in a year's time) and for this reason it must be paired with another form
of energy in order to guarantee power at night and during winters, especially for
factories and other power-hungry appliances such as electric trains.

** Is nuclear power considered renewable?
There is currently a debate on whether or not the nuclear energy should
be considered renewable. Nuclear fission (or fusion, in the future) produce
heat, which is then used to turn water into steam to power a steam turbine.
Unlike other forms of renewable energies, nuclear power requires fissible
material like uranium in order to function. For this reason, many does
not consider nuclear power a renewable form of energy. However, it must be
noted that uranium is present at great quantities on the Earth, especially
in ocean waters where it can be extracted. Uranium is also very energy dense,
meaning that few amount of material can produce great quantities of energy,
meaning that we won't run out of uranium even if we powered the entire Earth
with nuclear power.
Since nuclear power does not produce CO2, it is also considered green by the
European Union.
