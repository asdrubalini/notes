#+title: Modern age

* Age of anxiety and crisis of certainties
After the first world war, where almost a million British soldiers died,
the country was left with a cynical mood. Nothing seemed to be right or
certain.

The growing crisis of confidence was also due to the introduction of relativity theory in
science, which stressed its hypothetical nature. It discarded the concepts of time and
space, which he conceived of as subjective
dimensions. As a consequence the world
view lost its solidity and the scientific revolution was complemented by the verbal experirnentation and the exploration of memory in literature, the rebellion against perspective and against phenomenal representation in art, or the revolution of tone,
rhlthm and harmony in music.
